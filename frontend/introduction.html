                <p>Dear Participant,</p>
                
                <p>Thank you for participating in this study. Before you begin, please review the general principles for what makes a high-quality note.</p>
                
                <h3>Guiding Principles for Evaluation</h3>
                
                <p>To help ensure consistency, please keep the following characteristics of a high-quality note in mind during your evaluation.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Helpful:</strong> A helpful note adds necessary, factual context or clarifies key information in the original post.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Clear:</strong> It is easy to understand, using direct and simple language.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> It focuses on verifiable facts and maintains a neutral tone, avoiding personal opinions or argumentative language.</p>
                
                <h3>Your Tasks</h3>
                
                <p>You will be evaluating approximately 20 posts. For each post, you will be shown two notes ('Note A' and 'Note B') and will have three main tasks:</p>
                
                <p><strong>1. Is this note helpful?</strong></p>
                <p>First, you will provide an overall helpfulness rating for each of the two notes individually ('Helpful', 'Somewhat Helpful', or 'Not Helpful').</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. What was helpful about it?</strong></p>
                <p>Next, you will evaluate each note on several specific qualities, keeping the guiding principles in mind.</p>
                
                <p><strong>3. Choose the more helpful note:</strong></p>
                <p>Finally, you will make a direct comparison and choose which of the two notes you believe is more helpful overall.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> The principles above are for general guidance. Your personal and honest judgment is what matters most. There are no "right" or "wrong" answers.</p>
                
                <p>Thank you for your careful evaluation!</p>
